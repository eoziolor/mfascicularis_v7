All figures were generated by the D-GENIES web platform (http://dgenies.toulouse.inra.fr)
on April 14, 2020, using default options. The Strong Precision checkbox for each figure
was checked to remove lower quality alignments; all other figure options were left the
default. Note that the D-GENIES web platform does not return the generated alignments
or provide an explicit list of command line options used in a job.
